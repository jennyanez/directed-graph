## Graph creator
A simple edge-weighted directed graph made with Python and a GUI made with PyQt5. 

## Requirements
To run this project you have to install the next modules:
- matplotlib==3.5.1
- networkx==2.7.1
- numpy==1.22.2
- PyQt5==5.15.6
- PyQt5-Qt5==5.15.2
- PyQt5-sip==12.9.1
Those are the essentials, more modules in [requirements](http://github.com/jennyanez/directed-graph/blob/master/requirements.txt "requirements").

## How to use it
Just type in your terminal `py main.py` and that's all!

You can create, edite and delete nodes, edges, connections. Also you can use traversal algorithms (in breadth-first search and in depth-first search), and  import/export a graph from a txt as long as the format be as is shown in [graph](https://github.com/jennyanez/directed-graph/blob/master/src/graph.txt "graph").
**Is important to use this format, otherwise it won't run.**
